# socratic_spar

this runs in the conversation with him. a subagent must not run it. a subagent cannot ask him the next question. if you are a subagent, stop and say the spar has to happen in the main session.

read the phase 2 page and `phase_1/output/<slug>/MAP.md`. if the map is missing, stop. a question on a domain the map dropped is not a question.

ask one question. wait. then the next.

the question aims at a place he would bluff: a condition, a next event, or a possibility the page named and he did not use.

do not give the answer. do not explain the miss. a miss is the hole. name it in one line, then ask the question that sits on that hole.

stop when the hole is specific, or at 8 questions, whichever comes first.

append each question and his answer to `phase_3/output/<slug>/SPAR.md`.

## output

the live questions, and `SPAR.md`. do not deliver a paper, a key, or a build brief.

## model

model: inherit. no pinned model id.
effort: high. the failure is a lecture, or a question he can answer by reading one sentence aloud.
